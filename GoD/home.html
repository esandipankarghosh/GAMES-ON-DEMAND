            Facebook And Unity Team Up To Create PC Gaming Platform Competitor To Steam
            </div>

            “Unity and Facebook are joining forces to build new functionality into Unity that streamlines the process for exporting and publishing games onto Facebook,” reads the official statement from Facebook.<br>
<br>
“This will allow Unity developers to quickly deliver their games to the more than 650m players who enjoy playing Facebook-connected games every month – a massive and highly-engaged gaming community that enabled Facebook to pay out over $2.5bn to just web-game developers in 2015 alone.”<br>
<br>
Before you go and grab your flaming pitchforks though, Facebook’s new PC gaming platform will apparently run outside of the usual Facebook browsing experience. From the sounds of things it’ll be its own dedicated gaming client. Facebook tout it as distraction free, so it looks as if we’ll be able to turn off all those pesky notifications and pokes.<br>
<br>
Facebook has already started letting a small group of developers into the closed alpha as it looks to build towards an official launch.<br>
<br>
In and of itself this wouldn’t normally be all that interesting. Gaming on Facebook is usually casual fare like Candy Crush, Farmville and Bejeweled, but spinning it out into its own desktop gaming platform, away from the browser, will allow Facebook to publish more demanding gaming experiences and catering toward the hardcore.<br>
<br>
Factor in too that Facebook also owns Oculus with its own Oculus Store, and it also happens to have bundles of cash, and you can clearly see the path which Facebook could take here.<br>

            Up for Debate- How long will Pokemon Go craze last?
            </div>

            There’s no doubting Pokemon Go has taken the world by storm over the past fortnight. Hundreds of millions of eager trainers have given the free game a download, and all sorts of crazy stories have sprung up surrounding its success. But the big question for Nintendo, Niantic and The Pokemon Company is - how long can this last?<br>
<br>
All three partners will be desperate to ride this gravy train as long as possible, squeezing every last penny out of fans desperate to snag a rare Zapdos or Mew. What’s obvious right now though is that Pokemon Go is a global phenomenon remarkably light on content. There are only actually a few things you can really do - walk around looking for Pokemon and Poke Stops, walk around hatching eggs, or get stuck into some rudimentary battling at gyms.<br>
<br>
Pokemon Go may be tugging at the nostalgia strings of millennials, and doing it very well, but that’s about it. The majority of people over the age of 30 who didn’t grow up with Pokemon probably wonder what the heck is going on. Once that initial giddy nostalgia rush passes for most of us, what’s left?<br>
<br>
The paucity of content certainly raises a few questions over Pokemon Go’s longevity. When you think Pokemon you think of turn-based Pokemon battles, whereas what we have here is a shell of that system. A proper battling system is needed where players can take each other on while out and about. A trading system is also a must, giving players in more remote locations a chance to complete their collections.<br>
<br>
Of course Niantic is probably beavering away on this as we speak, and it’s also got six more generations of Pokemon to fall back on. Catching 150 Pokemon is a big enough task as is, but there’s 600 more and counting still to be added to the base game. Is this enough to hook players in for the long term?<br>
<br>
Over to you then. Are you still playing Pokemon Go? Do you think it has a long tail? How long until this craze fades away?

            Sonic games announced to mark 25th Anniversary: Sonic Mania

            Friday marked the 25th anniversary of Sega’s classic Sonic franchise, and the Japanese giant turned PC publishing behemoth took the opportunity to announce not one but two new Sonic titles - Sonic Mania and Project Sonic 2017.<br>
<br>
The former is what long-time series fans have been crying out for, for years - an honest to goodness throwback to classic Sonic Mega Drive titles. Sonic the Hedgehog 4 in all but name, Sonic Mania is all chiptune music, 2D visuals and gotta go fast platforming. It’s scheduled for a Spring 2017 launch, when it’ll arrive on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. No Nintendo consoles bizarrely.

            Plans for the next generation of processors are beginning to shift into focus, with both Intel and AMD outlining launch windows for their respective Kaby Lake and Zen CPUs.<br>
<br>
Intel was first, with CEO Brian Krzanich announcing during a Q&A session with investors that Kaby Lake CPUs are finalised and shipping to PC builders for use in complete systems.<br>
<br>
That doesn’t necessarily mean we can expect to see them hit store shelves anytime soon but the pieces are certainly moving for an expected launch in late 2016.<br>
<br>
AMD meanwhile is beginning to prep large scale manufacturing of its 14nm Zen CPUs. These in particular feel as if they’ve been ages in coming, but president Lisa Su has confirmed a small volume desktop launch in 2016 before mass volume in early 2017.

            Razor Announces HDK2 VR Headsets with 1200p display for same price as PSVR.

                	Razer has just put up pre-orders for its own virtual reality headset. Designed by the open standard OSVR                    consortium, it’s a VR headset designed to be totally open source with no hardware or software limits in place                    on its use. Where things get really interesting though is that the Razer OSVR HDK 2 has basically identical                    specs to the Oculus Rift, all while retailing for a significantly cheaper price.<br>
<br>
                    Pre-orders are available from now up until its shipping date on July 29th, with the OSVR HDK2 setting you back                    $399 / £399, significantly undercutting the $600 Oculus Rift and $800 HTC Vive.

            Ubisoft claims Nintendo NX is looking "Really Great" and will recliam a large Audience.
            </div>
        	<img src="home images/595 (1).jpg">
            <div class="a_item">
            		It’s been well over a year since the Nintendo NX was officially announced and yet we still know next to                    nothing about the mysterious console. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has shed a little more light on the situation                    however, saying he believes Nintendo’s console will be attractive enough to draw the audience's seen in the                    Wii’s heyday, before the much maligned Wii U dropped in 2012.<br>
<br>
                    “What we have seen is really great," claimed Guillemot in a Ubisoft earnings conference call. "We think having                    a new machine coming is going to help the industry to continue to grow, and to take lots more casual players                    back to the industry.”<br>
<br>
                    Just how Nintendo intends to recapture the casual audience remains to be seen, but this isn’t a company that                    plays by the usual rules. Nintendo is reliant on innovation and fresh ideas (at least in the hardware space);                    sometimes they hit, sometimes they don’t, so expect something right out of left field.<br>
<br>
                    It’s also not clear just when Nintendo is finally planning to take the wraps off the NX, but the Japanese                    giant has reiterated that everything is moving towards a March 2017 worldwide launch. “Nintendo is also                    devoted to the development of a gaming platform codenamed "NX" with a brand-new concept, which will be                    launched in March 2017 globally,” wrote Nintendo in its 2016 Annual Report.
